Pinba 1.1.0      ?? ??? ????
----------------------------
- Added schema field (mostly to distinguish between HTTPS/HTTP traffic).
- Added memory footprint field.
- Added nested messages to allow packet data 'buffering' without reinventing data streaming.
- Added request tags (used to filter requests).
- Added tagN_reports supporting arbitrary number of timer tags.
- Added 'histograms' - a way to look beyond the 'average' numbers.
- Added support of percentiles in reports.
- Added rusage to timers and timer reports.

- Greatly improved locking and performance.
- All reports now support conditions (min_time/max_time and request tags).
- All CPU-intensive operations with package data are now done using the thread pool (spreading across all available CPU cores).
- Switched to Protobuf-C version to improve performance (this also removes one more library dependency).
- Fixed bug in tag report generation (some data was added, but never deleted from the report).
- Dropped pinba_tag_report_timeout, make sure to remove it from my.cnf.

Pinba 1.0.0      17 Aug 2012
----------------------------
- Added tag_report2 and tag2_report2 mostly replicating their first versions, 
  but with additional grouping by server name and hostname. (Denis Yeldandi)

- Implemented thread pool.
  * The threads are allocated at the startup and killed only on shutdown;
  * The number of threads is equal to the number of CPUs available (or 8 by default);
  * Incoming GPB packages are decoded using the thread pool;
  * Tag reports are updated using the thread pool.

- Implemented timer pool with caching.
  * Timers are reused in order to avoid unnecessary malloc()'s.
  * Reimplemented reading from the 'timers' table, simplified the code.

  Together with using the thread pool, this means a huge performance gain, 
  though Pinba is now a lot more memory hungry since none of the timers are ever freed.

- Fixed reading from timertag table by key.
- Fixed race condition when reading timer tag values.
- Fixed MySQL 5.5 build.
